## Introduction 

The Mind Garden is my first assessed portfolio project developed as part of the Code Institute Full Stack Software Developer Bootcamp, consisting of learning outcomes to utilise HTML5, CSS3 & Bootstrap in order to fulfil the necessary requirements for the brief provided about safeguarding.

The live project can found here: <a href="https://markrshaw99.github.io/The-Mind-Garden/" target="_blank">The Mind Garden</a>

## Colors

Color selection is a key component...

To ensure compliance to standards, the [Colour Contrast Checker](https://colourcontrast.cc/) (also available as extension on [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/colour-contrast-checker/nmmjeclfkgjdomacpcflgdkgpphpmnfe)) was used.<br>
Both the [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) and the [Adobe](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-contrast-analyzer) color contrast tools were used to corroborate these results.

## Fonts

As with color, font was a big consideration for ensuring a positive user experience whilst visiting the page.<br>
Two sans-serif fonts were selected for the project, and implemented via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) using a direct import code within the style.css file.

### Wireframes

These low-fidelity wireframes have been created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to define the key feature layout to guide the user experience design. Utilising the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework and available components allows for the construction of a page that feels familiar for ease of navigation whilst also allowing for well structured content and a responsive design.

## Deployment


This [GitHub](https://github.com/) project was created using the [Code Institute Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/ci-full-template) ensuring all necessary dependencies were included when opening within the designated workspace on the [Gitopod IDE](https://www.gitpod.io/).

Setup a repo using this method and template:
1. Login to your GitHub profile.
2. Navigate to the Code Institute Full Template
3. Click the dropdown for 'Use this template' and select "Create a new repository"
4. Generate the necessary name and description for your repo and click 'Create repository from template'
5. Navigate to the new repo and click the green 'Open' button with the Gitpod logo<br>
**IMPORTANT - This button should only be clicked once to generate the new IDE workspace**
6. You can now work on your repository within the Code Institute Gitpod IDE workspace

Once the project repo is created, an early deployment for the live project should performed.<br>
This allows for early and continuous testing using a variety of devices, as well as the Dev Tools available within browsers.

Additional information on the deployment process can be found on the official [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart)

This included regular debugging and testing using the Dev Tools as ptovided within Chrome Browser.
