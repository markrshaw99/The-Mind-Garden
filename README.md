## Colors

Color selection is a key component...

To ensure compliance to standards, the [Colour Contrast Checker](https://colourcontrast.cc/) (also available as extension on [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/colour-contrast-checker/nmmjeclfkgjdomacpcflgdkgpphpmnfe)) was used.<br>

## Fonts

As with color, font was a big consideration for ensuring a positive user experience whilst visiting the page.<br>
Two sans-serif fonts were selected for the project, and implemented via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) using a direct import code within the style.css file.

### Wireframes

These low-fidelity wireframes have been created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to define the key feature layout to guide the user experience design. Utilising the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework and available components allows for the construction of a page that feels familiar for ease of navigation whilst also allowing for well structured content and a responsive design.
